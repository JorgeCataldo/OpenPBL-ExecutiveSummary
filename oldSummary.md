## SHORT PITCH 
Problem-based learning (PBL) is a learning strategy successfully adopted by some higher education institutions, such as Harvard, Minerva, and 42. At PBL, students learn by **solving problems** and **reflecting on their experiences**. Among its advantages, the pragmatism of the learning experiences, which **accelerates students' employability gains** in the job market.
 
However, despite the advantages of using PBL, the creation of PBL-oriented educational business models that can **be replicated on a global scale** is still an **unresolved problem** for the education sector. To address the **scaling problem of PBL use**, an experienced executive of educational sector proposes an innovative **technology-intensive** strategy based on **strategic partnerships** with key suppliers.

To implement and execute the strategy, he developed the **business plan** of an **edtech company**, whose financial simulations show outstanding performance after five years of operation. Under the proposed business model, annual **net revenues** of **$ 2.1 million** (EBITDA 55%) can be obtained for each new business unit launched at a cost of **$ 63,000**, with no relevant geographic limitations to scale the company's activities. The investment required for the edtech startup and launch of the first *business unit* is **$ 163,000**, mostly spent on CAPEX. 

All investment required to implement the plan will be provided by the venture capital that will be raised in at least three future investment rounds. The main **exit rule** for attracting investors is the edtech's potential *strategic sale* to a global **real estate** or **education** company.

**Seed capital** <br>
In order to validate some business plan assumptions, the company needs investments of about **$ 38,000** in **pre-operating expenses**. For this early stage investment, the entrepreneur offers **3% equity** interest in the company. 

**Series A** <br>
To proceed to the next step of starting and launching its first BU in São Paulo (Brazil), edtech needs investments of around **$ 163,000**, which will be spent mostly on the development of **software systems** and **new problem case titles**. For the investment, the entrepreneurs offer a **12% equity** interest in the company.

## OFFERING STORYTELLING 

MARIA LUCIA CASE, 2019, SÃO PAULO

Maria Lúcia is 23 years old and she is the oldest daughter of a lower-middle-class family living in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Her **professional long-term goal** is to be the **marketing director of a large company**. As the first step toward realizing her professional dream, she enrolled in a college degree in Marketing, which she hopes to complete in two years.  

Part of the course Maria Lucia is taking is face-to-face and her classes take place at night. During the day she works as a saleswoman at a women's clothing store. Her **professional short-term goal** is to get a **marketing analyst position** in a retail chain store next year.

On a November morning, Maria Lucia receives on her smartphone the following message:
 
“Hi Maria Lucia. To move a little further toward your professional goals, it is important that you attend a **problem-session** that can address the topic **Customer Service**. From your most recent achievements, I see that you're ready for this learning experience. Therefore, I suggest and encourage you to follow this path. Count on my help in this additional step of your professional growth.”

Happy with the message, Maria Lucia immediately accepts the recommendation from her **virtual career assistant**. Further, she receives a list of problem-sessions hosted by WeLearn addressing the issue and that will occur in the following weeks in Sao Paulo city. In this list she can see the dates, places, maximum number of participants, type of dynamics and the profile of the **expert authors** and **tutors** of the problem-sessions.

Maria Lúcia enjoys the "**challenge type**" problem-sessions and has a lot of fun when the dynamics are "**simulation type**" or "**game**", but she is focusing on the "**case study**" problem-session. She imagines herself in the future making strategic decisions just like the case study's actors.

Among the available options, Maria Lúcia is in doubt between two: the session that takes place very **close to her home** and the session that has the **lowest price**. She decides to attend the problem session closest to her home because, in addition to this advantage, she has an 85% “match” on the recommendation of her career assistant.

Maria Lúcia has almost all the necessary knowledge to attend the session she has chosen, but she still needs '**advanced level**' certification in the domain **Service Marketing**. Since she already has an '**intermediate level**' certification for this same topic and the event will be in two weeks, she estimates that she will have enough time to prepare and obtain the certification she still lacks.

The following day, during the subway commuting to the workplace, Maria Lúcia begins preparing for certification. She begins by answering a series of questions about the subject of Service Marketing. With each error in the answers, Maria Lúcia receives several suggestions of links to articles, blogs, podcasts, videos and courses, where she can study the content she needs to eliminate her **knowledge gaps**.

Some of the suggestions are free, some not. She'd love to take a suggested e-learning about Warthon service marketing. However, with this month's budget already exhausted, Maria Lucia decides to study only by the content of suggestions freely available on the internet.
...
Throughout the following week, Maria Lúcia researches, interacts with others interested in the same certification, asks questions in specialized forums and finally answers all the questions proposed to obtain the certification she sought. Certified, she can finally complete the registration to attend the problem-session that her virtual assistant suggested.

Fortunately, the session’s expert author did not require certification to be validated by a **face-to-face assessment** at a **partner certifier**. If so, Maria Lúcia would have to schedule the test at lunch break because the movement in the store where she works is already very high at this time of year.
…
The problem-session that Maria Lúcia chosed will study **the case of a fictional department store**. Maria Lúcia already hoped that the preparatory material provided by the session's mentor would be extensive and detailed because she opted for a type session premium. Even so, she was surprised by how many charts, tables, and simulation spreadsheets she received. She soon realized that she wouldn't see her friends over the weekend, but she's happy. It's for a good cause.
...
Maria Lucia needs to read the case material very carefully and prepare her case for the questions that will be asked of her group at the initial stage of the session. In addition, this argument will be your starting point in discussions at the final and most important stage of the session.
…
At the scheduled day and time, Maria Lucia goes to the venue of the session. It is a co-working with a modern and very stimulating environment for her. Being with all those people, moving in harmony through the various co-working environments gave her a very positive vibe. She likes that environment. And it's not just for the good coffee they offer.

She is excited but also anxious. After all, **the expert author is a senior manager** at one of the largest supermarket chains in the country. She is sure he has the ideal profile and experience to pose a truly challenging problem for a marketing analyst of retail sector. While waiting for the other students, she wonders how many analysts have come under her command over the years. How many he would have already hired for his team. How many were really good and were promoted. Deep in her heart, she could not wait to become one of them, and this was the opportunity to get an even simulated idea of what it would be like.

Maria Lúcia considers herself well prepared to attend the event, but is a little anxious because she is a bit shy and will have to defend her views to the tutor who will drive the session dynamics and the other 9 participating students.

She will certainly receive criticisms and have to argue against it to be well evaluated by the tutor and her peers. Still, Maria Lúcia does not expect to have the same difficulties she had in the initial sessions she attended, when she didn't go well because of shyness. Since then, she has been encouraged to analyze her mistakes and successes in the videos recorded in previous sessions and to insist on **problem-based learning** because these sessions make up what is closest to the environments, interactions, and real problems she will face in companies where she will practice her profession.

After the session that lasted 3 hours, Maria Lúcia is exhausted, but satisfied with her performance. His professional development was noticeable this time. She wants to get home to watch the recording and the transcript of the session. She wants to check her expectation regarding the evaluation of her performance by the mentor criteria and also by the evaluation of the other students participating in the session.

Maria Lúcia ends the event with the feeling that she is able to apply, with increasing security and clarity, the knowledge learned in the college that she is attending. She will no longer feel so insecure in the decisions she makes in problem-sessions, and this is gradually reflected in her behavior in the real world work environment. She really feels like moving fast toward her professional dream.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

**THE OPPORTUNITY**

**Problem-based learning** <br>
Problem-based learning (PBL) is a learning strategy successfully adopted by some higher education institutions. It is possible to identify the application of PBL in some internationally recognized educational systems, such as in the case study classes of Harvard’s medical and business schools, in the “teacherless” operation of IT School “42”, and in Minerva's global course architecture. 

At PBL, students learn by solving problems and reflecting on their experiences. They work in small collaborative groups where they learn what they need to solve a problem presented. In this context, the teacher acts more as a facilitator to guide student learning than as the holder of knowledge, as in traditional methods. 

Among its advantages, the pragmatism of their learning experiences accelerates students' employability gains in the job market. With PBL, it is possible to assess the performance of individuals in solving simulations of real and typical problems of their jobs. This type of assessment is not the main goal of other more popular learning strategies, such as the “subject-based strategy” of higher education schools or the “competency management strategy” adopted by most companies. 

In companies, this performance is commonly estimated by the managers during the annual performance evaluation process. Thus, much of the value to companies obtained through the application of PBL is related to efficiency gains and risk reduction in the process of direct evaluation of professional performance. 

**The scaling problem of PBL** <br>
Despite the advantages of using PBL, the creation of PBL-oriented educational business models that can be replicated on a global scale is still an unresolved problem for the education sector. By demanding high-level educational resources for their preparation and execution, the expansion of the activities of PBL-driven educational business compromised as they do not achieve diminishing returns to scale. This scale problem entails an important constraint on PBL dissemination and universalization as learning strategy. 

**Solving the scaling problem of PBL** <br>
To address the scaling problem of PBL use, an experienced executive of educational sector proposes an innovative technology-intensive strategy based on strategic partnerships with key suppliers. The main objective of the strategy is to keep the supply of the two largest direct cost items in the education sector - hosting and faculty- at high levels, even as company activities increase. 

Unlike most edtechs that favor digital operations to achieve diminishing returns on the scale of their activities, the proposed model bases the company's scalability on: (1) the use of third party assets, and (2) atomized non-digital operations.

Regarding the cost structure of traditional models, the strategy envisages:
Replace teachers as content producers with experienced professionals in their careers;
Replace traditional classes with many students with atomized learning experiences;

In order for the strategy to be executed, intensive technology support is required in the form of: 
State-of-art expert system to assist content producers in developing problem scenarios;
Artificial intelligence applied to assess student performance (facial recognition, speech-to-text and natural language processing);

<br>
<br>
**THE BUSINESS** <br>

**Edtech company** <br>
With the increasingly intensive use of technology, edtechs are currently assuming the role of protagonists in proposing solutions to the most varied problems in the education sector. The use of new technologies is responsible for the current role of edtechs that use them not only to design new products, but also to reduce costs and generate scale for scaling up activities.

The current configuration of the educational business landscape presents an excellent window of opportunity for innovative models that set out to solve the PBL scale problem. To take advantage of the current window of opportunity in today's education sector scenario the creation of an Edtech, which address the PBL's scale problem with an innovative technology-intensive strategy based on partnership with key suppliers.

The core of edtech’ offering are career-focused and low-cost PBL experiences. Moreover, continuous offering to the target audience characterizes a scalable PBL-oriented educational business model, whose learning attributes can be summarized as:
Lifelong, adaptive, and problem-based educational system;

**Core of offering** <br>
The products offered by the company are face-to-face problem-solving sessions, or simply “PBL Sessions”,which can be purchased in isolation or along tailor-made student trails. Sessions can be “attended” at any time in the places where they are offered.  

Each “PBL Session” is:
- 3-hour non-virtual meeting conducted by a tutor (via web conference);
- For a group of 10 students familiar with the terms and knowledge of the problem domain;
- Who have successfully completed preparatory activities;
- In order to solve and discuss solutions to real and typical problems of their jobs;
- Each student's participation is recorded and made available on audiovisual media;
- Each student receives feedback on their individual and group performance;

**Target audience** <br>
The audience of PBL Sessions are individuals from the economically active portion of the population who are interested in promoting or accelerating the gain of their employability. The personas that fit the profile of the target audience are.  
Students from higher schools, attending the final third of their educational programs;
Graduated professionals seeking relocation or career advancement;
Employees listed in corporate learning and development (L&D) plans (B2B target audience);

**Market value proposition** <br>
The value proposition for the market is that continued participation in PBL sessions accelerates student employability gains. 

<br>
<br>

**BUSINESS PLAN** <br>

**Edtech business model** <br>
Jorge Cataldo is an engineer with 15 years of experience conducting business units of large higher education institutions for executive and corporate education. To implement and execute the strategy, he developed the business plan of an edtech company, whose financial simulations show outstanding performance after five years of operation.

PBL Sessions can be marketed to the target audience, both at retail, and for companies empower its staff. The B2C trading strategy depends on the level of investment raised. With low investment available for attraction and conversion actions, sales can be accomplished through partnerships with retail channels specializing in educational products. Similarly, B2B marketing can circumvent a low level of investment through partnerships with professional associations and entities. 

The main company's revenues are derived from the sale of PBL Sessions. And the direct costs are: (1) customer acquisition costs, and (2) operational execution costs of PBL sessions. Also, the edtech will focus the capital expenditure (capex) in developing the problem scenarios.

**BU expected performance** <br>
Under the proposed business model, it is possible to achieve an annual net revenue of $ 2.1 million (EBITDA 55%) for each new business unit launched at a cost of $ 63,000.

The following assumptions were used to simulate the company's operations under the business model described in the business plan:
OBS.: As  at an unspecified location, the main business indicators are referenced by NET REVENUE, already deducted from local taxes.

- 5-year average price -  $505 
- SAL* in year 2 -  3.466 
- Conversion rate (sales/SAL) for year 2 -  80,0% 
- Year 2 wholesale revenue -  $0 K 
- Recurring revenue rate -  0% 
- Conversion rate (sales/leads) for year 2 -  1,29% 
- Average annual revenue growth -  90,0% 

*SAL = Sales Accepted Lead*

- Annual average sales - 1.023 
- Annual Net Revenue average growth - 83,7% 
- Annual Net Revenue in year 5 - $1,2 M
- Net Revenue carry over by year-end 5 - $0
- Year 5 EBITDA ($) - $0,4 M
 -Year 5 EBITDA (% Net Revenue) - 32,0% 
- Free cash generation of year 5 ($) - $0,2 M 


**ENTERPRISE VALUE (EV)**
- Discount rate (a.a.) - 10,0% 
- DCF (5 YEARS, WACC) - $0,2 M
- EV by DCF plus perpetuity - $2,1 M 
- EV / NR multiple for EdTechs - 3,30 
- EV by EV / NR multiple - $4,2 M 
- Average EV - $3,1 M 

*EV = Enterprise value*

**Funding and exit rules** <br>
The minimum initial investment required for the edtech startup and launch of the first BU is $ 163,000, mostly spent on CAPEX. All investment required to implement the plan will be provided by venture capital by at least three fundraising rounds. The main exit rule for investors is the strategic sale of edtech to a global real estate or education company.

**Seed capital** <br>
In order to validate some business plan assumptions, edtech needs investments of about $ 40,000 in pre-operating expenses. For the investment, the entrepreneurs offer 3% equity interest in the company (EV = $3.0 million). The main goals for the actions to be implemented by the seed capital are: 

- To run a concierge MVP in three cities;
- To validate some business plan assumptions;
- Investor must helps on Series A funding;

**Series A** <br>
To start and launch its first BU in São Paulo (Brazil), edtech needs investments of around $ 163,000, which will be spent mostly on the development of software systems and new problem case titles, as well as some working capital. For the investment, the entrepreneurs offer a 12% equity interest in the company (EV = $4.0 million). The main goals for the actions to be implemented by the Series A capital are:
- Mainly spent in capital expenditures;
- Development of software systems and PBL session titles;
